# Overview of Project: 

In the past few years, climate change has caused extreme weather events across the global, such as heat waves in Europe during summar 2022, blizzard snow storms in Buffalo, flooding caused by atomphseric rivers in California, intense hurricans in Florida and many more. Therefore, we wanted to select a topic that's related the co2 emmision that direcly relates to man caused climate change.  According to the Paris Agreement, in order to address the problem, the world as a whole must lower emissions to limit the global average temperature increases to 1.5C, which requires a reduction of CO2 emissions of 45% in 2030 or a 25% reduction by 2030 to limit warming to 2C [1].

## Study the dataset we choose
We selected this dataset which includes Emissions by countries over period of 200 years. 
It also includes the following eight contributing factors.
* Total: total amount of CO2 emissionfor the country 
* coat: The amount of CO2 emission from coal for the country 
* Oil: The amount of CO2 emission from oil
* Gas: The amount of CO2 emission from gas
* Cement: The amount of CO2 emissin from cement production  
* Flaring: Tha amount of CO2 emissin from flaring operation
* Other: The amount of CO2 emission from other sources for the country
* Per Capita: The amount of CO2 emission per capita for the country 
## Check the dataset
* How big is this dataset, there are 63104 rows and time period starting from 1750 to 2021. 
* use Python to plot the trend of annual total global emissions.

***The plot shows the globlal emission level is exponetially growing.***
** Our goal is to predict the global CO2 emissions in the future year[2030,2040,2050,2100] by linear regression analysis.

## The questions that the team plans to answer with the project 


* Predict global CO2 emission in the future years by linear regression model.


* By using unsupervised learning, specifically K-means algorithm, we can cluster countries into producing similar CO2 emission. (checking out the last 50 years)
