# Group Project - Emission by Country
Carbon emissions and environmental protection issues become a widely used term and concept in the public debate on responsibility and abatement action against the threat of global climate change. Therefore, forecasting carbon emissions is of great significance to track countries' progress in meeting carbon emission targets set by the Paris Climate Agreement. This project analyzes estimates of global and national CO2 emissions using machine learning models aiming to predict CO2 emissions from country-specific parameters such as emissions from fossil fuels and emissions per capita.

# Dataset information
This dataset provided by CICERO Center for International Climate Research as part of the Global Carbon Project is an in-depth look into the global CO2 emissions at the country-level, facilitating a better comprehension of each nation's contribution to the global cumulative impact of human activity on climate. Emissions from coal, oil, gas, cement, flaring, and other sources, as well as emissions per capita, are all included in this country-level survey of global fossil CO2 emissions.
